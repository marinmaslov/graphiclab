  👨🏼‍💻 Development & 🌐 Production
</h3>

## 💡 Purpose

### 👨🏼‍💻 Development

This branch contains the newest/latest code. The code isn't necessarily stable (e.g. working properly). Once developers submitted enough commits and test them all, this branch will be merged with the production one (so that it will contain the latest stable code).

### 🌐 Production

This branch contains the latest stable code (e.g. working code without errors). Once the code on the development branch is tested it can be merged into production.

## 🏷️ Other branches
