  🏷️ The main branches are:

<h3 align="center">
  🌐 master, 👨🏼‍💻 development & 🍭 design
</h3>

<br>

## 💡 Purpose

### 🌐 Master

This branch contains the latest stable code (e.g. working code without errors). Once the code on the development branch is tested it can be merged into master.

### 👨🏼‍💻 Development

This branch contains the newest/latest code. The code isn't necessarily stable (e.g. working properly). Once developers submitted enough commits and test them all, this branch will be merged into the master one (so that it will contain the latest stable code).

### 🍭 Design

This branch contains the Low and High Fidelity page designs. Each file listed in the low_fidelity direcotry below contains two designs: one for the 🖥️ desktop and one for the 📱 mobile version of the app's pages. The the high_fidelity direcotry is further divided into subdirectories, with names matching the app's pages, containing the 🖥️ desktop and 📱 mobile designs.
