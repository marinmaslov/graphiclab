With a number of simultaneous competitions every week, spanning a number of topics and photographic styles, these events are judged by an official panel of professional photographers, whose input maintains a consist influx of high quality, creative images.</p>
        <p>The combination and integration of specialized image editing technologies, coupled with unique features and community competitions allows for Fotor’s continual growth and development.
